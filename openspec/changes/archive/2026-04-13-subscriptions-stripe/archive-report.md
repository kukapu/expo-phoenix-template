## Implementation Outcome

### Test Results
| Suite | Tests | Result |
|-------|-------|--------|
| Backend (ExUnit) | 122 | ✅ All passed |
| Mobile (Vitest) | 76 | ✅ All passed |

### Coverage
- Backend subscription-related files: ~93% average
- Backend total: 86.65% (below 90% threshold — pre-existing gap)
- Mobile: No coverage tool installed

### TDD Compliance: 6/6 checks passed

### Spec Compliance: 31/35 scenarios compliant (2 N/A Stripe SDK delegation, 1 untested, 3 partial)

## Remaining Warnings (Non-blocking — Follow-up Considerations)

1. **W1: Webhook flag-off returns 404 vs spec 200** — Spec says webhook should be "acknowledged with 200 but no processing occurs" when flag disabled. Implementation uses RequireFeature plug which returns 404 before reaching the controller. Architecturally correct but spec-deviation. Recommend: update spec to match implementation, or restructure webhook pipeline.

2. **W2: BillingScreen has zero test coverage** — `billing-screen.tsx` exists with subscription status display and cancel flow, but no behavioral test file. Structural correctness verified but no test assertions.

3. **W3: No subscription tab indicator** — Spec requires "a subscription indicator or tab is present within the authenticated shell" when flag enabled. Only drawer entry implemented; `tabItems` in routes.ts has no subscription entry.

## Suggestions (Nice to Have)

- S1: Add error-path tests for BillingController (65% coverage) and ReqImpl (71%)
- S2: Wrap React state update in act() in subscription-shell.test.tsx
- S3: Install @vitest/coverage-v8 for mobile test coverage visibility
- S4: Move hoisted import in billing-screen.tsx to conventional position

## Source of Truth Updated

The following main specs now reflect the new behavior:
- `openspec/specs/feature-flags/spec.md` (NEW)
- `openspec/specs/billing-context/spec.md` (NEW)
- `openspec/specs/subscription-feature-mobile/spec.md` (NEW)
- `openspec/specs/mobile-shell-navigation/spec.md` (UPDATED — 2 requirements added)
