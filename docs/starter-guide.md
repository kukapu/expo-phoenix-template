# Starter Guide

## What This Starter Includes

The starter is split into base modules and optional modules.

Base modules:

- Native auth with Google and Apple
- Session persistence and refresh
- Expo Router shell with public and private boundaries
- Shared UI primitives and shell components
- Runtime config bootstrap from backend
- Feature flags consumed inside the mobile tree

Optional modules:

- Subscriptions with Stripe Payment Sheet

The routes under `apps/mobile/app/(app)` — `home`, `user`, `settings` — are intentional placeholders: empty scaffolds that exercise the shell, navigation, and session wiring. Replace them with product-specific screens when building on top of the starter.

## Production Readiness

This repo is a robust reusable starter, not a turnkey production deploy.

Before shipping a real app on top of it, you still need to decide and wire:

- CORS policy (no plug wired by default — native-only apps may not need it; web builds do)
- Rate limiting on `/api/auth/:provider/callback` and `/api/session/refresh`
- A real TLS termination story (the Endpoint forces SSL in prod; your infra needs to actually terminate it)
- Real values for every env var flagged in the "Enabling Subscriptions" and "Auth Setup Notes" sections

Runtime config refuses to boot in prod when required env vars are missing, so you'll get a loud failure rather than a silent fall-through to test credentials.

## Architecture Rules

Keep these rules stable when extending the starter:

1. `packages/contracts` is the source of truth for backend/mobile payloads.
2. Runtime config comes from backend `/api/config`, not from ad-hoc props.
3. Shared shell code stays generic and must not own product-specific business logic.
4. Optional modules should disappear cleanly when their feature flag is disabled.
5. App-specific product features should follow the same `presentation/application/domain/infrastructure` split used by the optional modules.

Optional routes and optional navigation entries should register themselves through the add-on registry instead of being hardcoded directly into the authenticated shell.
Domain visibility rules should live in reusable helpers and evaluate session data such as `user.roles` and `user.tier`, not ad-hoc booleans scattered across screens.

## Mobile Bootstrap Flow

At startup the mobile app:

1. Resolves the API base URL
2. Fetches `/api/config`
3. Builds the runtime feature flag reader
4. Mounts `RuntimeConfigProvider`
5. Mounts `SessionShellProvider`
6. Mounts add-on providers only when the active module needs them

This keeps the base app tree stable while optional modules mount their own runtime only when used.
The settings screen can resolve addon entry points from the same registry, which keeps future optional menus out of the shell core.

## Backend Responsibilities

The Phoenix backend currently owns:

- provider callback completion for Google and Apple auth
- session refresh and revoke flows
- runtime config bootstrap

Optional billing add-on responsibilities:

- billing plans and subscription state
- Stripe Payment Sheet session initialization

The mobile root no longer mounts Stripe. The subscriptions route owns the billing runtime so the SDK is loaded only when that add-on is active.

### Stripe Subscription Flow

The starter wires a real recurring subscription, not a one-off charge:

1. `POST /api/billing/subscribe` creates a Stripe `Subscription` with
   `payment_behavior=default_incomplete` and `expand[]=latest_invoice.payment_intent`.
   Stripe returns the subscription id and an embedded `PaymentIntent` client
   secret.
2. Backend persists a local row with `status="pending"` and the **real**
   `stripe_subscription_id`.
3. Mobile confirms the `PaymentIntent` via Payment Sheet.
4. Stripe fires `customer.subscription.updated` with `status="active"`. The
   webhook handler resolves the local row by `stripe_subscription_id` and
   promotes it from `pending` to `active`.
5. Subsequent state transitions (`past_due`, `unpaid`, etc.) flow through
   the same webhook.
6. `POST /api/billing/cancel` updates the Stripe subscription with
   `cancel_at_period_end=true`
   and marks the local row `canceling`. `customer.subscription.deleted`
   later finalizes it to `canceled`.
7. `POST /api/billing/abandon-pending` is the path for "user closed Payment
   Sheet without paying" — it best-effort cancels the Stripe-side
   incomplete subscription and removes the local pending row.

Cancel only operates on `active` / `canceling` rows. Pending rows must go
through the abandon path. Plans seeded in `billing_plans` must reference
real Stripe `Price` IDs (`stripe_price_id`) for the subscription creation
to succeed in production. `past_due` subscriptions still block new subscribe
attempts until they are resolved or canceled, so the starter does not create
duplicate Stripe subscriptions for the same user.

## Enabling Subscriptions

Subscriptions are controlled by the backend runtime flag:

- `ENABLE_SUBSCRIPTIONS=true`

When enabled, the backend should also expose Stripe runtime configuration:

- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`
- `STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`
- `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`
- `STRIPE_MERCHANT_DISPLAY_NAME`
- `STRIPE_MERCHANT_IDENTIFIER` for iOS if needed
- `STRIPE_URL_SCHEME`

In production, `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, `STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`, and `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` are required when `ENABLE_SUBSCRIPTIONS=true` — the backend refuses to boot if any are missing. In dev/test, harmless placeholders are used if they are not set.

Production also requires these auth salts (generate with `mix phx.gen.secret`):

- `AUTH_ACCESS_TOKEN_SALT`
- `AUTH_REFRESH_TOKEN_SALT`

If `ENABLE_SUBSCRIPTIONS=false`, the mobile shell hides subscription navigation and the subscription route redirects away.

## Auth Setup Notes

Mobile auth expects Expo/native configuration to be present.

Current mobile app config lives in `apps/mobile/app.config.ts` and should be driven by env vars.

Important values:

- `expo.scheme` — used for native redirects and Stripe return URLs
- `expo.extra.googleWebClientId`
- `expo.extra.googleIosClientId`
- iOS bundle identifier and Android package name

Recommended mobile env vars:

- `EXPO_APP_NAME`
- `EXPO_APP_SLUG`
- `EXPO_APP_SCHEME`
- `EXPO_ANDROID_PACKAGE`
- `EXPO_IOS_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER`
- `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL_ANDROID`
- `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL_IOS`
- `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL_WEB`
- `EXPO_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_WEB_CLIENT_ID`
- `EXPO_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_IOS_CLIENT_ID`
- `GOOGLE_IOS_URL_SCHEME`

Backend Google token verification expects matching provider audiences:

- `GOOGLE_WEB_CLIENT_ID`
- `GOOGLE_IOS_CLIENT_ID`

Backend runtime variables are documented in `apps/backend/.env.example`.

When cloning this starter into a new app idea, update these identifiers before shipping.

## Creating a New App on Top of This Starter

1. Rename app identity in `apps/mobile/.env` or your deploy env vars
2. Update bundle/package identifiers
3. Point mobile to the correct backend base URL if needed
4. Configure auth provider credentials
5. Decide whether subscriptions are enabled for this app
6. Add product-specific features under `apps/mobile/src/features/<your-feature>`
7. Reuse `shared/ui`, `shared/config`, and existing shell boundaries

## Where To Extend Safely

Good extension points:

- `apps/mobile/src/features` for new product features
- `apps/mobile/src/shared/ui` for reusable design system pieces
- `packages/contracts` for shared payload changes
- `packages/mobile-shared` for reusable mobile adapters
- `apps/backend/lib/your_app_web/controllers/api` for new API endpoints

Avoid:

- hardcoding feature flags in layouts
- bypassing shared contracts with one-off payload shapes
- putting app-specific domain logic into `shared/ui` or shell navigation
- mixing role/tier visibility checks directly into random screens when the same rule can live in `src/shared/authz`

## Verification Workflow

Use these commands before treating changes as starter-safe:

- `pnpm test:mobile`
- `pnpm test:backend`

For backend-only changes, also run `mix precommit` inside `apps/backend`.
